1) Memory leak (have not seen this lately)

The following snippet used to grow in memory (and may still) - please
notify me if anyone still observes this and even better has a fix.

perl -le '
use SNMP;
$obj = new SNMP::Session DestHost, "dubravka";
while (){
print $obj->get(["ifNumber",0]);
}
'

***Note: need to verify this with the async API as well***

2) not sure if this is a bug but I can cause a crash with a 'goto
LABEL;' from within an async callback function.

3) the following varbing format is not encoded correctly ... I have seen this crash the agent as well

$sess->get(["sysDescr.0"]);

use the following instead:

$sess->get(["sysDescr",0]);
or
$sess->get("sysDescr.0");
