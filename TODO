implement an asynchronous interface so multiple requests can be sent out
and responses can be handled with a call-back. probably should make an
SNMP::snmp_callback which can be installed with Tk's fileevent or a
general select loop (and/or EventDrivenServer) This would really be
easier and more reliable/compatible if/when event handling is moved to
the perl core.

allow unloading and reinitialization of parsed MIB (change to ucd-snmp?)

allow MIB use on a per Session basis (ie. dependent on agent type and
version, loaded mib might be different (yes I know properly designed
mibs should eliminate the need for this but not all mibs are well
behaved))

I think the error handling is fixed now - but it could use some
validation/going over. See that informative strings are returned and the
the error number is useful in all cases.

implement more v2-isms. and v3 isms?

add trap generation/handling

ensure module does not complain with -w.

add more tests

add POD docs to SNMP.pm (I have some patches around someplace for this)
