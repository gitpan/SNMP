Improve asyncronous interface. probably should make an
SNMP::snmp_callback which can be installed with Tk's fileevent or a
general select loop (and/or Event module) This would really be easier
and more reliable/compatible if/when event handling is moved to the
perl core. allow SNMP::MainLoop to handle timer based polling.

look for *Not Implemeted* and implement :)

allow unloading and reinitialization of parsed MIB - write access to
mib tree (change to ucd-snmp?)

allow MIB use on a per Session basis (ie. dependent on agent type and
version, loaded mib might be different (yes I know properly designed
mibs should eliminate the need for this but not all mibs are well
behaved))

I think the error handling is fixed now - but it could use some
validation/going over. See that informative strings are returned and the
the error number is useful in all cases.

implement v2 traps and v3 sessions? (ucd-snmp changes required)

ensure module does not complain with -w.

add more tests

add POD docs to SNMP.pm (I have some patches around someplace for this)
