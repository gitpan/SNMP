allow argument to set/get/getNext to be a numeric OID in addition to a
'tag.iid'. if the input arg is a numeric OID then getNext would return a
numeric OID as well.

add a 'getType' method to lookup SNMP type(syntax) for a given object so
some formatting of retrieved value can be done for packed types like
(OCT_STR, IP_ADDR, OID etc.) currently you must know what type you are
getting back and unpack accordingly.

I think the error handling is fixed now - but it could use some
validation/going over. See that informative strings are returned and the
the error number is useful in all cases.
(  Hi Joe,

   I'm confused as to what is returned by
   SNMP::Session::set.  For success and failure
   I get 0, although ErrorStr contains a message
   on failure.

implement an asynchronous interface so multiple requests can be sent out
and responses can be handled with a call-back.

implement more v2-isms. (assuming some stability and consensus on what
that is)

- Wish: would be nice if you could add a make test target

Btw. On top of my wish list is making SNMP work with -w.
