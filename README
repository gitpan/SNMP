Introduction:

This is a Perl5 extension module which provides an interface to the
CMU-SNMPv2 library. It was developed on a linux box and tested on a
sun4_4.1 system using CMU-SMNMPv2.1.2. There have been reports of
success on irix and solaris systems so far. (Let me know of problems
and/or successes on other boxes please)

the most recent version of the module can be retrieved from
ftp:/ftp.wellfleet.com/netman/snmp/perl5/SNMP.tar.gz
(as well as the usual perl archives)

cmu source may be found in a variety of locations, try
ftp://ftp.ece.ucdavis.edu/pub/snmp (sun, hp port etc.)
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/admin (linux)


Description:

The basic operations offered by SNMP are provided through an object
oriented interface for modularity and ease of use. The primary object is
SNMP::Session which is implemented as a blessed hash reference. The
object supports 'get', 'set', and 'getNext' method calls. All calls are
blocking/synchronous (i.e., they must recieve a response or timeout
before control is returned to the caller). The methods take a variety of
input argument formats(see test/snmptest.pl for examples). A description
of the objects data fields follow.

SNMP::Session
 DestHost - required on creation, either hostname or ip addr of SNMP agent
 Community - default 'public', SNMP community string
 Version - default '1', v1 support only for now
 Timeout - default '1000000', micro-seconds before retry
 Retries - default '5', retries before failure
 RetryNoSuch - default '1', for get request NOSUCH errors, the pdu will
               be repaired, removing the varbind in error, and resent -
               undef will be returned for all NOSUCH varbinds, setting
               to '0' disables this feature and the entire get request
               will fail on any NOSUCH error
 ErrorStr - read-only, returns a test description of any error occuring
            in the last request
 ErrorNum - read-only, returns the snmp_err or staus of last request
private
 DestAddr - internal field used to hold the translated DestHost field

In addition a number of package variables and methods are provided

$SNMP::release - the current version specifier (e.g., 1.5b)

$SNMP::auto_init_mib - default '1', enables the immediate loading of the
                       ASN mib when the package is loaded - if set to '0'
                       mib loading must be done explicitly (see SNMP::setMib)

SNMP::setMib - allows dynamic re-initialization of the mib to be used

SNMP::translateObj - will convert a text object tag to a numeric OID and
                     vice-versa. iid suffix is always retained numerically


Installation:

build/install version 2.1.2 of CMU-SNMPv2 libsnmp.a (e.g., /usr/local/lib)

make sure header files are available someplace (e.g., /usr/local/include)

in ext/SNMP 'perl Makefile.PL'

then 'make install'

the CMU tool-kit requires that an ASN mib be available. 'mib.txt' is the
default name looked for first in the local directory and then in
/etc. See CMU-SNMP docs for details on overriding the default or set mib
explicitly with SNMP::setMib.

assuming you have an SNMP agent to talk to you can customize test/snmptest.pl
and run

'cd test; perl snmptest.pl <agent-address>'
