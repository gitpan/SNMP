Introduction:

This is a Perl5 extension module which provides an interface to the
UCD SNMP client toolkit. The UCD SNMP Library is based on version
2.1.2.1 of the CMU SNMP Library and has incorporated many bugfixes and
enhancements. For information on the UCD SNMP Library see the
documentation provided with the UCD SNMP distribution.

(NOTE: In previous releases this module was compatible with both the
UCD and CMU SNMP libraries. Starting with Perl5/SNMP-1.7 this module
will only work with the UCD SNMP Library 3.3.1 or later due to
dependence on new features)

Availability:

The most recent release of the UCD SNMP Libray can be found at:
ftp://ftp.ece.ucdavis.edu/pub/snmp/ucd-snmp.tar.gz

The most recent release of the Perl5/SNMP module can be found at:
ftp:/ftp.wellfleet.com/netman/snmp/perl5/SNMP.tar.gz
(as well as the usual perl archives, CPAN)

Supported Platforms:
	SunOS 4.1.x
	Solaris 2.x
	Linux 1.2.x, 2.0.x
	Many other UNIX variants
	Win95/NT   ***NEW***

Installation:

build and install ucd-snmp-3.3.1 or later

note: you should ensure that any previous ucd-snmp installation is
completely removed.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

note: for 'make test' to succeed you should ensure that an agent running 
(e.g., /usr/local/sbin/snmpd) 

Operational Description:

The basic operations offered by SNMP are provided through an object
oriented interface for modularity and ease of use. The primary class
is SNMP::Session which is implemented as a blessed hash
reference. This class supplies 'get', 'getnext', 'set', 'fget', and
'fgetnext' method calls. All calls are currently blocking/synchronous
(i.e., they must receive a response or timeout before control is
returned to the caller - an asyncronous implementation is very high on
the TODO list). The methods take a variety of input argument formats
(see below).

A description of the fields which can be specified when an
SNMP::Session object is created follows:

SNMP::Session
public:
 DestHost    - default 'localhost', hostname or ip addr of SNMP agent
 Community   - default 'public', SNMP community string (used for both R/W)
 Version     - default '1', [2 (same as 2c), 2c, 3 (not implemented)]
 RemotePort  - default '161', allow remote UDP port to be overriden
 Timeout     - default '1000000', micro-seconds before retry
 Retries     - default '5', retries before failure
 RetryNoSuch - default '1', 'get' request NOSUCH errors in the pdu will
               be repaired, removing the varbind in error, and resent -
               undef will be returned for all NOSUCH varbinds, setting
               to '0' disables this feature and the entire get request
               will fail on any NOSUCH error (applies to v1 only)
 VarFormats  - default 'undef', used by 'fget[next]', holds an hash
               reference of output value formatters, (e.g., {<obj> =>
               <sub-ref>, ... }, <obj> must match the <obj> and format
               used in the get operation. A special <obj>, '*', may be
               used to apply all <obj>s, the supplied sub is called to
               translate the value to a new format. The sub is called
               passing the Varbind as the arg
 TypeFormats - default 'undef', used by 'fget[next]', holds an hash
               reference of output value formatters, (e.g., {<type> =>
               <sub-ref>, ... }, the supplied sub is called to translate
               the value to a new format, unless a VarFormat mathces first
               (e.g., $session->{TypeFormats}{INTEGER} = \&mapEnum();)
 UseLongNames - defaults to the value of SNMP::use_long_names at time
               of session creation. set to non-zero to have <tags>
               for 'getnext' methods generated preferring longer Mib name
               convention (e.g., system.sysDescr vs just sysDescr)
 UseSprintValue - defaults to the value of SNMP::use_sprint_value at time
               of session creation. set to non-zero to have return values
               for 'get' and 'getnext' methods formatted with the libraries
               sprint_value function. This will result in certain data types
               being returned in non-canonical format NOTE: values returned
               with this option set may not be appropriate for 'set' operations
               (see discussion value formats in <vars> description section)
 UseEnums    - defaults to the value of SNMP::use_enums at time of session
               creation. set to non-zero to have integer return values
               converted to enumeration identifiers if possible, these values
               will also be acceptable when supplied to 'set' operations
 ErrorStr    - read-only, holds the error message assoc. w/ last request
 ErrorNum    - read-only, holds the snmp_err or staus of last request
 ErrorInd    - read-only, holds the snmp_err_index when appropriate

private:
 DestAddr    - internal field used to hold the translated DestHost field
 SessPtr     - internal field used to cache a created session structure

methods:
 new(<fields>)   - Constructs a new SNMP::Session object. The fields are
                   passed to the contructor as a hash list
                   (e.g., $session = new SNMP::Session(DestHost => 'foo',
                   Community => 'private');), returns an object reference
                   or undef in case of error.
 update(<fields>)- Updates the  SNMP::Session object with the values fields 
                   passed in as a hash list (similar to new(<fields>))
 get(<vars>)     - do SNMP GET, multiple <vars> formats accepted,
                   updates <vars> with value(s) and type(s), returns
                   retrieved value(s)
 fget(<vars>)    - do SNMP GET like 'get' and format the values according
                   the handlers specified in $sess->{VarFormats} and
                   $sess->{TypeFormats}
 getnext(<vars>) - do SNMP GETNEXT, multiple <vars> formats accepted,
                   returns retrieved value(s), <vars> passed as arguments are
                   updated to indicate next lexicographical <obj>,<iid>,<val>,
                   and <type> NOTE: simple string <vars>,(e.g., 'sysDescr.0')
                   form is not updated
 fgetnext(<vars>)- do SNMP GETNEXT like getnext and format the values according
                   the handlers specified in $sess->{VarFormats} and
                   $sess->{TypeFormats}
 set(<vars>)     - do SNMP SET, multiple <vars> formats accepted,
                   the value field in all <vars> formats must be in a canonical
                   format (i.e., well known format) to ensure unambiguous
                   translation to SNMP MIB data value (see discussion of
                   canonical value format <vars> description section),
                   returns snmp_errno
 getbulk(<non-repeaters>, <max-repeaters>, <vars>)
                 - * Not Implemented *
 trap()          - * Not Implemented *
 
Acceptable variable formats:
<vars> may be one of the following forms:

 SNMP::VarList:  - represents an array of MIB objects to get or set,
                   implemented as a blessed reference to an array of 
                   SNMP::Varbinds, (e.g., [<varbind1>, <varbind2>, ...])

 SNMP::Varbind:  - represents a single MIB object to get or set, implemented as
                   a blessed reference to a 4 element array;
                   [<obj>, <iid>, <val>, <type>].
                   <obj>  - one of the following forms:
                          1) leaf identifier (e.g., 'sysDescr') assumed to be
                             unique for practical purposes
                          2) fully qualified identifier (e.g.,
			     '.iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr')
                          3) fully qualified, dotted-decimal, numeric OID (e.g.,
                             '.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1')
                   <iid>  - the dotted-decimal, instance identifier. for
                            scalar MIB objects use '0'
		   <val>  - the SNMP data value retrieved from or being set
                            to the agents MIB. for (f)get(next) operations
                            <val> may have a variety of formats as determined by
                            session and package settings. However for set
                            operations the <val> format must be canonical to
                            ensure unambiguous translation. The canonical forms
                            are as follows:
	                    OBJECTID => dotted-decimal (e.g., .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1)
			    OCTETSTR => perl scalar containing octets,
		            INTEGER => decimal signed integer (or enum),
			    NETADDR => dotted-decimal,
			    IPADDR => dotted-decimal,
			    COUNTER => decimal unsigned integer,
			    COUNTER64  => decimal unsigned integer,
			    GAUGE,  => decimal unsigned integer,
			    UINTEGER,  => decimal unsigned integer,
                            TICKS,  => decimal unsigned integer,
                            OPAQUE => perl scalar containing octets,
       			    NULL,  => perl scalar containing nothing,


                   <type> - SNMP data type (see list above), this field is
                            populated by 'get' and 'getnext' operations. In
                            some cases the programmer should populate this
                            field when passing to a 'set' operation. this
                            field need not be supplied when attribute
                            indicated by <tag> is already described by loaded
                            Mib modules. for 'set's, if a numeric OID is used
                            and the object is not currently in the loaded Mib,
                            the <type> fileds must be supplied

 simple string   - light weight form of <var> used to 'set' or 'get' a
                   single attribute without constructing an SNMP::Varbind.
                   stored in a perl scalar, has the form '<tag>.<iid>',
                   (e.g., 'sysDescr.0'). for 'set' operations the value
                   is passed as a second arg. NOTE: This argument form is
                   not updated in get[next] operations as are the other forms.

SNMP package variables and functions:

 $SNMP::VERSION       - the current version specifier (e.g., 1.7)

 $SNMP::auto_init_mib - default '1', set to 0 to disable automatic reading
                        of the MIB upon session creation. set to non-zero
                        to call initMib at session creation which will result
                        in MIB loading according to UCD env. variables (see
                        man mib_api)

 $SNMP::verbose       - default '0', verbosity level, 0 => no output

 $SNMP::use_long_names - default '0', set to non-zero to enable the use of
                        longer Mib identifiers. see translateObj. will also
                        influence the formatting of <tag> in varbinds returned
                        from 'getnext' operations. Can be set on a per session
                        basis (UseLongNames)

 $SNMP::use_sprint_value - default '0', set to non-zero to enable formatting of
                        response values using the snmp libraries sprint_value
                        function. can also be set on a per session basis (see
                        UseSprintValue) NOTE: returned values may not be
                        suitable for 'set' operations

 $SNMP::use_enums     - default '0',set non-zero to return values as enums and
                        allow sets using enums where appropriate. integer data
                        will still be accepted for set operations. can also be
                        set on a per session basis (see UseEnums)

 &SNMP::setMib(<file>) - allows dynamic (re?)parsing of the mib and explicit
                        specification of mib file independent of enviroment
                        variables. called with no args acts like initMib,
                        loading MIBs indicated by environment variables (see
                        ucd mib_api docs). passing non-zero second arg
                        forces previous mib to be freed and replaced 
                        (note: second arg not working since freeing previous 
                         Mib is more involved than before).

 &SNMP::initMib()     - calls library init_mib function if Mib not already
                        loaded - does nothing if Mib already loaded. will
                        parse directories and load modules according to
                        environment variables described in UCD documentations.
                        (see man mib_api, MIBDIRS, MIBS, MIBFILE(S), etc.)

 &SNMP::addMibDirs(<dir>,...) - calls library add_mibdir for each directory
                        supplied. will cause directory(s) to be added to
                        internal list and made available for searching in
                        subsequent loadModules calls

 &SNMP::addMibFiles(<file>,...) - calls library read_mib function. The file(s)
                       supplied will be read and all Mib module definitions
                       contained therein will be added to internal mib tree
                       structure

 &SNMP::loadModules(<mod>,...) - calls library read_module function. The
                       module(s) supplied will be searched for in the
                       current mibdirs and and added to internal mib tree
                       structure. Passing special <mod>, 'ALL', will cause
                       all known modules to be loaded.

 &SNMP::unloadModules(<mod>,...) - *Not Implemented*

 &SNMP::translateObj(<var>) - will convert a text object tag to an OID and
                            vice-versa. iid suffix is retained numerically.
                            default behaviour when converting a numeric OID
                            to text form is to return leaf indentifier only
                            (e.g.,'sysDescr') but when $SNMP::use_long_names
                            is non-zero the whole identifier will be returned

 &SNMP::getType(<var>) - return SNMP data type for given textual identifier
                        OBJECTID, OCTETSTR, INTEGER, NETADDR, IPADDR, COUNTER
                        GAUGE, TIMETICKS, OPAQUE, or undef

 &SNMP::mapEnum(<var>) - converts integer value to enumertion tag defined
                        in Mib *Not Implemented*

Trouble Shooting:

If problems occur there are number areas to look at to narrow down the
possibilities.

The first step should be to test the UCD installation independent from
the Perl5/SNMP interface. 

Try running the apps from the UCD distribution. 

Ensure that your MIBs are installed and enviroment variables are set
appropriately (see man mib_api)

Be sure to remove old ucd-snmp installations

If the problem occurs during compilation/linking check that the snmp
library being linked is actually the UCD library (there have been name
conflicts with existing snmp libs). 

Also check that the header files are correct and up to date. 

Sometimes compiling the UCD snmp library with
'position-independent-code' enabled is required.

if you cannot resolve the problem you can email me at
gmarzot@baynetworks.com and/or ucd-snmp-coders@ece.ucdavis.edu.
and maybe I can help.

please give sufficient information to analyze the problem (OS type,
versions for OS/Perl/UCD/compiler, complete error output, etc.)

Apologies to any/all who's patch/feature/request was not mentioned or
included - most likely it was lost when paying work intruded on my
fun. Please try again if you do not see a desired feature. This may
actually turn out to be a decent package with such excellent help and
the fact that I have more time to work on it than in the past.

------
History:

Bugs fixed and changes in 1.7

1) fixed seg fault on use of unknown/unparsed attribute in Varbind or
   passed to translateObj

2) fixed truncation of last char of attribute name in translateObj

3) handles variable args to setMib without complaint

4) added SNMP::getType to query data type of a given attribute and
   extended Varbind structure to return type wherever possible

5) added RemotePort to SNMP::Session initialation list to allow override
   of port 161

6) removed noisy announcement of mib parse success unless verbose is set

	       *WARNING*  *this may break existing scripts*
7) changed return format for IpAddress and ObjID data types - these are
   now always returned as dotted decimal strings as opposed to the
   packed binary forms in 1.6
	       *WARNING*  *this may break existing scripts*

8) Session now sets ErrorInd (e.g., $session->{ErrorInd}) where appropriate

9) Support for ucd-snmp-3.2 (and greater) style of Mib loading

10) Fully qualified attriubute names and numeric OIDs are now valid <obj>
   defintions.

11) Numeric OIDs can be used even if they have not been parsed in the
    current Mib - Mib loading is now optional

12) Support for Win32 perl

13) Updated docs and examples

14) Reworked/extended the test harness to use the perl t/* facility
    (thanks to jfs@fluent.com)

15) fixed up error handling to be more consistent with library and more
    useful in general. Now returns both library API errors and snmp
    protocol error numbers and strings.

16) added per object and per type formatting of returned values - more
    control of value formatting with UseEnums and UseSprintValue
